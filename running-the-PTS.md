# Running the Perl Toolchain Summit

These are my notes on how I think we do and should run the toolchain
summit. I'd like to have a clearly and openly documented model for the
event and how we run it. This is (a) to ensure it's the best/right
event for the toolchain community, (b) transparency on who gets to
attend and why, and (c) to help people who might be (considering)
running future summits.

I plan to have a session at the Lyon 2017 summit to go through this and
get feedback, but will also solicit feedback from further beyond.

## What is the PTS?

An annual summit where we assemble as many of the key developers for the
"perl toolchain" as we can, for 4 days working together.

Some issues need multiple people to work together, and gnarly issues
take time to work through. Given most of this is volunteer effort,
giving people 4 days together gives an opportunity to push through
things that might not otherwise happen.

Having people together means it's also an opportunity to have
face-to-face discussions to plan things that might be done after
the summit.

## Principles

* The scope is the tools that are used by people with Perl in
  Production. More on the scope below.
* The people who attend are those who have been working on those tools
  for the last year or so.
* They are generally all volunteers, so the only way we can afford to
  run this is with sponsorship.
* Sponsors generally support the summit because they have Perl in
  Production, and they can see the summit is a key driving force behind
  the maintenance and evolution of the toolchain.
* Attendees are generally all working in close proximity, so you need to
  get on with others. Regardless of your contributions, if you're a jerk
  you won't get invited, and if we discover you're a jerk at a summit,
  you're not likely to get invited back.

## Organising the Summit

These are all the things you need to get to the summit itself:

* Pick the location
* Decide who's coming
* Select the venue
* Pick the dates
* Raise sponsorship

### Picking the location

* So far it's always been in Europe, as 60-70% of the attendees are
  from Europe.
* Pick a city/town that's relatively easy to get to from Europe, USA,
  Canada, Brazil, and Japan.
* Easiest if it's the hometown for one of the organisers, as it
  makes life easier if someone can go talk to the venue, look at the
  rooms, etc

### Deciding who's coming

* Identify the core team and check if they think the core team should
  change this year. Roughly 10 people.

The core team vote for the next wave, identf
