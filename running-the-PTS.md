# Running the Perl Toolchain Summit

These are my notes on how I think we do and should run the toolchain
summit. I'd like to have a clearly and openly documented model for the
event and how we run it. This is (a) to ensure it's the best/right
event for the toolchain community, (b) transparency on who gets to
attend and why, and (c) to help people who might be (considering)
running future summits.

I plan to have a session at the Lyon 2017 summit to go through this and
get feedback, but will also solicit feedback from further beyond.

## What is the PTS?

An annual summit where we assemble as many of the key developers for the
"perl toolchain" as we can, for 4 days working together.

Some issues need multiple people to work together, and gnarly issues
take time to work through. Given most of this is volunteer effort,
giving people 4 days together gives an opportunity to push through
things that might not otherwise happen.

Having people together means it's also an opportunity to have
face-to-face discussions to plan things that might be done after
the summit.

The goal is to set things up to maximise the value we get out of the
event, as individuals, for the community, and for the sponsors. If we do
it right, those things are all aligned.

## Principles

* The scope is the tools that are used by people with Perl in
  Production. More on the scope below.
* The people who attend are those who have been working on those tools
  for the last year or so.
* They are generally all volunteers, so the only way we can afford to
  run this is with sponsorship.
* Sponsors generally support the summit because they have Perl in
  Production, and they can see the summit is a key driving force behind
  the maintenance and evolution of the toolchain.
* Attendees are generally all working in close proximity, so you need to
  get on with others. Regardless of your contributions, if you're a jerk
  you won't get invited, and if we discover you're a jerk at a summit,
  you're not likely to get invited back.

## Organising the Summit

These are all the things you need to get to the summit itself:

* Pick the location
* Decide who's coming
* Select the venue
* Pick the dates
* Raise sponsorship

### Picking the location

* So far it's always been in Europe, as 60-70% of the attendees are
  from Europe.
* Pick a city/town that's relatively easy to get to from Europe, USA,
  Canada, Brazil, and Japan.
* Easiest if it's the hometown for one of the organisers, as it
  makes life easier if someone can go talk to the venue, look at the
  rooms, etc

### Deciding who's coming

The goal is to pull "the right people" together, and for them to pull in
more of the right people, so a gravitational thing happens.

* Identify the core team and check if they think the core team should
  change this year. Roughly 10 people.
* The core team nominates people for the next wave, from which we
  identify roughly 10 people.
* Those two groups nominate more people, pulling in roughly another
  10 people.

Who are the core team?

* The lead people working on the core building blocks: PAUSE, CPAN
  clients, ExtUtils::MakeMaker, metadata spec, core test modules
* Lead people working on critical services & tools: CPAN Testers,
  MetaCPAN, Devel::Cover / CPAN Cover

People will come and go. Barbie was previously lead on CPAN Testers, but
now it's Doug Bell. MetaCPAN has now been deemed critical enough for
Olaf Alders to join the core in 2017.

Are there other components, tools, or criteria we should use for core?

How are attendees nominated? There have been various approaches in
recent years

* Email people & ask on IRC: "who else should come?" See who bubbles up
  and make a list. Iterate.
* For Rugby we asked people to nominate people, and I kept track in
  a spreadsheet, and sorted that on # votes. One problem was that
  some people nominated a lot of people, and others just nominated a
  few people.
* For Lyon I asked the core people to nominate up to 5 people each. We
  picked the top ~10 people, and then asked them to nominate.
* One idea for next year: people get 10 points. You can put all on
  one person ("I really want them to be there"), or spread across
  several people.
* Let people ask to be considered?

### Selecting the venue

* The last 2 years we've had the hacking space be the same place where
  we're staying. This minimises travel time each day.
* Single rooms for everyone. It means we need to raise more sponsorship,
  but given the intense time spent together, it's good to have your own
  space at night.
* Two meeting rooms. Generally better if everyone can fit into one of
  them, so the other can be used for discussions without disturbing
  everyone else.
* Good if there are some kind of breakout spaces. The bar works fine
  most of the time in Lyon, and similarly the bar worked well at Rugby.
* Decent (enough) selection of restaurants nearby, catering for
  vegetarians & vegans.
* Wifi that can handle 35 people.
